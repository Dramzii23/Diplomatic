- **QApplication**: This is the main event loop of your PyQt5 application. It handles system-wide events, such as mouse clicks and key presses. It's instantiated with `sys.argv` to allow command line arguments for your application.

- **QPixmap and QSplashScreen**: `QPixmap` is used to hold the image data for the splash screen. `QSplashScreen` is a window that you can show during startup while your application is loading. It's used here to display an image as a splash screen when the application starts.

- **MainWindow**: This is a custom class presumably defined in `main_window.py`. It represents the main window of your application. An instance of this class is created after the splash screen is shown.

- **QTimer**: `QTimer` provides a high-level programming interface for timers. It's used here to create a delay before closing the splash screen and showing the main window. The `singleShot` method is used to call a function after a specified number of milliseconds. In this case, it's used to close the splash screen and show the main window after 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).

- **sys.exit(app.exec\_())**: This line starts the event loop by calling `app.exec_()`. The `sys.exit()` function ensures that the script exits in a clean way when the event loop is exited.
